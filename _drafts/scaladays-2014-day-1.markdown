A conference like Scala Days makes you go home with a head full of fresh ideas and feel 'enthused' on all the stuff you saw and learned.

All session where record by Parleys and will be made available [half of July] but a collection has already been started with a link to all slides and code:

One side effect is that such a conference is in fact only the beginning for a lot the things you discovered. Usually it is too much to follow up on but I'll add the things I have marked anyway.

The Simple Parts (Martin Odersky)
====

In this session the goals was to show that in essence Scala is simple and a response to some controversies living in the different communcities around Scala.

It ranges over simple tips like  *'don't pack too much in one expression and find meaningful names'* to

Scala is unifier (OO & FP, scripting + solid language used in large projects to build their core business,...)

10 years old, we look at the original definition: "Scala is a scalable language" and a nice reference to James Iry's blog which you should really read if you haven't yet as it is hilarious.
Prof. Odersky's improved definition would be "Scala is modular language".

The last part had some interesting slides picked form a larger presentation but some parts didn't hit home.

Aha moments or interesting things I never realized or thought about before:
"weak composition shortcomings in a language require external dependency mgt frameworks"

Thing to digg deeper in:

  - 'Why functional programming matters' by John Hughes
  -

Quotes:

Did not get, must look further:
   - mapValues question: surprise, ack'ed by Odersky.
