# A path to learning Scala, Functional Programming and Akka

Below I describe a possible path to learn Scala, Functional Programming and Akka, some of the interests I have based on what I learned and path I have taken. It serves as a central point for me to keep track of interesting resources and maybe it helps someone else one day.

My first book Scala for The Impatient, first 11 chapters are free.
I also hear great things about Atomic Scala.

Sites:

- http://scala-exercises.47deg.com/
- http://exercism.io/ next time I learn another language from scratch I may use this site too. I was surprised how much you can learn by reviewing and 'nit picking' other people's code. Also it keep you up to date with things you may not need daily, for example: enumerations are pretty basic but if you do not need to write them for months it's good to write them once in a while.

## Functional programming:

Later on if you want to move on to a functional style of programming you can take : Functional programming in Scala at Coursera
