# A path to learning Scala, Functional Programming and Akka

Below I describe a possible path to learn Scala, Functional Programming and Akka, some of the interests I have based on what I learned and path I have taken. It serves as a central point for me to keep track of interesting resources and maybe it helps someone else one day.

My first book Scala for The Impatient, first 11 chapters are free.
I also hear great things about Atomic Scala.

Sites:

- http://scala-exercises.47deg.com/
- http://exercism.io/ next time I learn another language from scratch I may use this site too

## Functional programming:

Later on if you want to move on to a functional style of programming you can take : Functional programming in Scala at Coursera

Best sources on understanding monads:

-  [Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures][monads-pictures]

## Akka:
