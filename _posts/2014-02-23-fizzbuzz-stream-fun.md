[FizzBuzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) fun in Scala using Scala
[Streams](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream).

The straightforward implementation of FizzBuzz usually involves defining a list or array of fixed size 100, populate it
using a loop over the index and set the value in the list according to our Fizz Buzz specification.

[Streams](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream) are lazy lists in which elements are only evaluated when they are needed. This allows for a seemingly
infinite recursive loop looking definition as shown in the Fibonacci example below. The first line builds a sequence
of sums, the sum of `a` and `fibFrom` looks as it if will never end if not for the lazy evaluation.

The 2nd line is there for clarity to show how to calculate the nth Fibonacci number based on our `Stream` definition. The
`take` method will return a Stream still, so nothing is being evaluated until `toList` is called. (Note that in case
of an infinite collection `toList` may never terminate.)

Here is an alternate implementation of FizzBuzz using the [Stream](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream) class in the standard Scala API.

[`Stream.from(start:Int)`](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream$) creates
and infinite stream of integers and we map them using a function according to the FizzBuzz specification. We then take
the first `n` of this infinite list and convert it to a 'normal' Scala List.

To print the first 100:
{% highlight scala lineno %}
  fizzbuzz(100).foreach{ println(_) }
{% endhighlight %}

As a little extra, this is how we could test our FizzBuzz implementation using [ScalaCheck](http://www.scalacheck.org/):

*A more functional implementation of FizzBuzz (added November 2015)*

Thanks to [Dierk KÃ¶nig's implementation in Frege][frege]:

What I like about this implementation: 

- Much less conditionals. There is only 1 compared to 4 in the first implementation. And the order matters in the latter, if I do not put the `i % 15 == 0` check first the logic will fall apart. So if changes need to be made it is easier to introduce bugs in the one containing more conditionals.
- The code can be more easily built incrementally using the REPL. It just *flows* nicer. The `shout` method needs to be entered in one go, all or nothing.
- Closer to the specification. Consider the `i % 15 == 0` check in the first implementation a bit more: to fit the FizzBuzz specification better it would be more accurate to write it as  `i % 3 == 0 ||  i % 5 == 0`. This would up the conditional checks to 5 though. At first sight the concatenation in the functional implementation felt like a lucky shot, but in fact it fits exactly the specifaction of FizzBuzz: I suppose it is no coincidence we are shouting 'FizzBuzz', a concatentation, instead of 'Boo!'.

Note there is also `zipWithIndex` in Scala but I maintained the same "`zip` and `map`"-logic to keep the code more consistent and hence more simple.

*[A Fizzbuzz implementation using `Monoids` (Added July 2016)](monoid_example)* When time permits
I may expand this post with this example.
